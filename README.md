# 3-Month DSA Roadmap for Beginners

This roadmap is designed for beginners to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It spans 3 months with 2-hour daily study sessions and includes essential topics with 20-25 easy and medium-level questions for each. The goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA.

## Tips for Success:

- Practice daily and focus on understanding concepts.
- Use platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, or NeetCode for structured practice.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.
- Simulate mock interviews and regularly review weak areas.
